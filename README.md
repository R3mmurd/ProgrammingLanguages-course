# Programming Languages Parts [A](https://www.coursera.org/learn/programming-languages), [B](https://www.coursera.org/learn/programming-languages-part-b) and [C](https://www.coursera.org/learn/programming-languages-part-c)

This repository contains examples codes and my solutions for programming
assignments and exams in this set of courses. You should not use these codes
for your own solutions in case you are doing the course. But you could study
them for learning purposes.

- [Part A](https://www.coursera.org/learn/programming-languages): In this part
  we studied the programming language [SML](https://www.smlnj.org/sml.html).
  It is covered in the directories: [week01](week01/README.md),
  [week02](week02/README.md), [week03](week03/README.md), [week04](week04/README.md),
  and [week05](week05/README.md).

- [Part B](https://www.coursera.org/learn/programming-languages-part-b) In this
  part, it is introduced the programming language [Racket](https://racket-lang.org/).
  It is covered in the directories [week06](week06/README.md), [week07](week07/README.md),
  and [week08](week08/README.md).

- [Part C](https://www.coursera.org/learn/programming-languages-part-c) In this
  part, it is introduced the programming language [Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/).
  It is covered in the directories [week09](week09/README.md), [week10](week10/README.md),
  and [week11](week11/README.md).

Each week's directory contains all of the sample code developed through the course. Moreover,
some of these directories contain a pdf file with the specification of homework, a file
with the homework solution, and a file with tests.
