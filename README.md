# Programming Languages Parts A, B and C

This repository contains examples codes and my solutions for programming
assignments and exams in this set of courses. You should not use these codes
for your own solutions in case you are doing the course. But you could study
them for learning purposes.

Part A is covered in the directories from week01 to week05 in the programming
language SML.

Part B is covered in the directories from week06 to week08 in the programming
language Racket and some codes in SML.

Part C is covered in the directories from week09 to week11 in the programming
language Ruby, some codes in Racket and SML.
